Lets do a demo

I will create a controller to fetch the student list with parameters
-> created date
-> name
-> and pagable

we have to we specification to use criteria query and we need to extend JpaSpecificationExecuter from repository

We write conditions for query in predicate so we need to create predicate.

SInce from date and to date are not mandatory so we check whether the provided date is null
or not, if not then we should add condition in query and same follows to name also.

from date cannnot be greater than to date so check is performed.

Now lets add some values and test

Lets add some parameters

Now test pageable by setting value page and size in request param

THANKS FOR WATCHING !!!
